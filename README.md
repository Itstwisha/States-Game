# States-Game

Built a educational and interesting game,

which gets you to guess and learn all of the States in the US. And the

inspiration comes from a quiz on Sporcle

where it has a map of all the States,

it's all blank until you start guessing some States,

and then you keep going until you've managed to get all 50. Or like me,

you get stuck at 11 out of 50.

This game tests you on your knowledge of the names of the 50 States in the US.

So for example, if I go and add another state and I hit

OK,

then that name appears on the map at the location of the state.

The aim of the game is to remember all of the names of the states and to name as

many of them as you can. You can keep track of scores too and 

if you can't recall states don't worry 

it will give you a CSV file for all remaining states you couldn't guess.

A fun game, guess the state and pin it to the map. 

Created using turtle library and pandas for the state's data set.
